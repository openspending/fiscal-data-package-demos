# Original Description

    Through Cohesion Policy funding, the EU invests approximately â‚¬50
    billion each year in economic development at the national and
    regional level (around 34% of the total EU budget). These
    investments are designed to help Member States and regions reach
    the Europe 2020 goals of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

    In order to increase transparency and to promote debate on the
    performance of EU funding, this open data platform provides
    information about the investments made and the results obtained
    (as well as contextual data on the socio-economic situation in
    each EU country). The figures concerning the outputs of EU
    Cohesion Policy Operational Programmes are based on reports
    provided to the Commission by Member States. The data can be
    reused free of charge, provided that you acknowledge the source
    (see legal notice). Comments on the data presented here and
    suggestions of additional datasets are welcome.
