    The CAP Payments data is also available to download as an Excel
    spreadsheet file. This contains all the information published on
    the website including the breakdown of subsidies paid by scheme or
    measure. For small beneficiaries who receive less than €1,250 in
    total subsidy (equivalent to £1,045), beneficiary names are
    withheld and replaced by a code number. The spreadsheet consists
    of separate tabs for each UK Paying Agency’s data.

    Data for the 2014 EC financial year (payments made between 16
    October 2013 and 15 October 2014) can be downloaded here. Please
    note that the file size is approximately 33Mb.

    You may need to install Microsoft Excel Viewer which is available
    free of charge but requires installation.

    The data is made available for the purpose of not-for-profit
    research only and without warranty or liability of any kind.
